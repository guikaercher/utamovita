# How to use

## Configure
Run keyDetector and bind the keycode to the key, for example add a key for F1 button in config.json at keymap like "59": "F1". That means F1 keycode is 59

## Choose a sound
Almost same as previous but you will set key and soundname.mp3 like "F1": "utamo_vita.mp3"

## Run
Execute the index.js
